### Limitations and how to avoid them

The Photopea API to open images is limited by the CORS policy of the website the image is hosted in.

You can read more about that [here](https://www.photopea.com/api/#:~:text=Cross%2DOrigin%20Resource%20Sharing)

One solution that I have found for the moment is to install another extension that bypasses the CORS policy for any website.

If you're a beginner developer like me then you should already have an extension like that. If not, please try it out, it will end your suffering when dealing with apis.

Personally I am using one called CORS Unblock. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to provide a link so I wont.
