### Possible issues and how to solve them 

The Photopea API that enables this feature is limited by the CORS policy of the website hosting the image you want to open.

This is explained [here](https://www.photopea.com/api/#:~:text=Cross%2DOrigin%20Resource%20Sharing)

One way to bypass this problem is with another extension. I personally use one called CORS Unblock.

I don't know if I'm allowed to provide a link so I won't. You can look it up yourself.
